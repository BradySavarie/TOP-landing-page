# TOP-landing-page

The purpose of this project is to help me improve my html and css skills (using flexbox in particular). I am going to be recreating a webpage from scratch based off of a provided template. I plan on making this webpage more personalized by using the GWS brand that I developed awhile back and will be making changes to the stock assets, colors, etc. as I see fit.
